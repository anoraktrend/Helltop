# Helltop

**Fuck the corporate cloud. Build your own.**

A personal website and digital rebellion headquarters for a self-hosting
enthusiast and digital freedom advocate. Built with Nuxt Content,
TailwindCSS, and a whole lot of defiance against surveillance capitalism.

## About

This is the source code for [helltop.net](https://helltop.net), a website
dedicated to:

- **Self-hosting everything** - Email, repos, files, media - if you're paying
  rent for storage that sits on someone else's hardware, you're a serf in
  digital feudalism
- **Open source exclusively** - Proprietary software is a cage; the source
  code is the key
- **Burning down surveillance capitalism** - Every "free" service is a
  panopticon
- **Weaponizing self-reliance** - Learn to run your own infrastructure or
  accept that you'll always be at the mercy of some corporation's quarterly
  earnings call
