# Welcome to My Digital Workshop

**Breaking free from corporate control, one self-hosted service at a time.**

I'm a developer who believes in owning your data, controlling your infrastructure, and building technology that serves people rather than profit margins. This is my corner of the internet where I share tools, guides, and projects for those who want to reclaim their digital autonomy.

## Philosophy

The modern web has become a walled garden dominated by megacorporations that treat users as products. I'm here to push back against that trend by:

- **Self-hosting everything possible** – From email to git repositories, your data belongs on servers you control
- **Building with open source** – Proprietary software is a trap; freedom requires transparency
- **Rejecting surveillance capitalism** – Your online activity shouldn't be monetized without your consent
- **Empowering self-reliance** – Learn to maintain your own infrastructure instead of depending on "the cloud"

## My Projects

### Utility Software

**AEE** – A terminal-based text editor for those who believe the command line is where real work happens. No bloat, no telemetry, just efficient text editing.

**mfutil / music-folder-utils** – Music library management software that respects your file system. Organize and maintain your music collection without surrendering it to streaming services that can revoke access at any time. Your music, your files, your control.

### System Interests

**Iglunix** – I'm actively interested in and exploring Iglunix, a GNU-less Linux distribution. The GNU project has its place in history, but exploring alternative userland implementations pushes us toward a more diverse and resilient Unix-like ecosystem. Iglunix represents a commitment to minimalism and breaking free from assumed dependencies.

## Find My Code

All my work is available on platforms that respect user freedom:

[**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/anoraktrend) [**GitHub**](https://github.com/anoraktrend)

I prioritize Codeberg as a non-profit, community-driven alternative to corporate git hosting, but maintain GitHub mirrors for accessibility, ci, and legacy purposes.

## What I Believe In

**Own Your Stack** – Understand every layer of your technology, from hardware to application. Dependency on opaque systems is vulnerability.

**Terminal First** – GUIs are training wheels. The terminal is where you have true control over your computing environment.

**Local Storage Over Cloud** – Your files should live on drives you physically control. Streaming and cloud storage are convenience traps that compromise ownership.

**Minimal Dependencies** – Every dependency is a potential point of failure and a piece of someone else's agenda in your stack. Build lean, build focused.

**Alternative Implementations** – Monocultures are fragile, whether in agriculture or software. Explore alternatives to dominant tools and ecosystems.

## Core Topics

**Self-Hosting & Homelab** – Running your own infrastructure, from basic services to complete personal cloud environments.

**Command Line Mastery** – The terminal isn't just a tool, it's a philosophy of direct control over your computing.

**Music & Media Liberation** – Managing your personal media libraries without corporate intermediaries.

**System Minimalism** – Questioning bloat, exploring lightweight distributions, and challenging "essential" dependencies.

**Privacy & Autonomy** – Building systems that respect your right to operate outside corporate surveillance.

## Get In Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with developers, sysadmins, and digital freedom advocates who question the status quo. Whether you're exploring GNU-less systems, building your first homelab, or just tired of corporate platforms dictating your computing experience, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:lucyrandall@helltop.net) or contact me through my repositories or contribute to my projects.
