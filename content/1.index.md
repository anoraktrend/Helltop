# Welcome to My Digital Rebellion
**Fuck the corporate cloud. Build your own.**
I'm a self-hoster who's done with watching Big Tech monetize every keystroke, harvest every click, and lock you into ecosystems designed to extract maximum profit from your digital life. This is my war room where I build tools, share tactics, and forge weapons for anyone ready to tear down the walled gardens and reclaim what's rightfully theirs: complete control over your computing.

## Manifesto
The internet is dying under the boot of surveillance capitalism. Five corporations own your digital existence. They've turned "the cloud" into a euphemism for "rent-seeking middleman" and "user-friendly" into code for "we control everything."

I'm not here to reform this system. I'm here to fucking dismantle it by:
- **Self-hosting everything** – Your email, your repos, your files, your life. If you're paying monthly rent for storage that sits on someone else's hardware, you're a serf in digital feudalism.
- **Building with open source exclusively** – Proprietary software is a cage. The source code is the key. Anyone telling you otherwise profits from your captivity.
- **Burning down surveillance capitalism** – Every "free" service is a panopticon. Stop volunteering for your own surveillance.
- **Weaponizing self-reliance** – Learn to run your own infrastructure or accept that you'll always be at the mercy of some corporation's quarterly earnings call.

The cloud isn't the future. It's a scam. Host your own goddamn servers.

## Arsenal
### Combat-Ready Software
**Quester** - A modern, visually rich MPD (Music Player Daemon) client built with Qt 6 and QML. Features cover-flow navigation, dual visualizers (custom spectrum analyzer + projectM/Milkdrop), automatic album art fetching, and MPRIS support. A celebration of music and visual experience that proves you don't need Spotify to enjoy your own music library.

**AEE** - A terminal text editor that doesn't treat you like an idiot who needs permission to edit text. No bloat. No telemetry spyware. No corporate overlords deciding what features you "really need." Just pure, uncompromising text editing for people who refuse to surrender the command line.

~~**mfutil / music-folder-utils**~~ (ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF [**BEETS**](https://beets.io/)) - Music library management that lets you actually OWN your fucking music. Spotify can revoke your access tomorrow. Apple can delete your library in a licensing dispute. Your local filesystem can't. Stop paying rent to stream music you could own. Rip it, organize it, keep it forever.

[**GITEA**](https://git.helltop.net) - I host my own git server, in the long shot chance Codeberg sinks. Why Gitea instead of forgejo? Because I'm too lazy to make an APK (for Asustor NASes, not alpine or android) for it. (it's super slow, but I enjoy using it, you can join with discord!)

[**Nextcloud**](https://nextcloud.helltop.net) - My Nextcloud Instance. Why use google's BS when you can host your own with even more and better features? Nextcloud does almost everything I need there. (usage is restricted to trusted friends, you know where to go if you wanna get access.)

[**Jellyfin**](https://jellyfin.helltop.net) - My Jellyfin instance, the beating heart of my media library. Streaming services got you down? Own a bunch of DVDs, Blurays, and CDs? Rip all of them to your local storage solution and host your own! I'll have to make a blog post talking about how to do that with Tailscale as your LAN<->WAN access tool. (usage is restricted to trusted friends, you know where to go if you wanna get access.)

[**Immich**](https://immich.helltop.net) - My Immich! Remember how I said Nextcloud does *Almost* everything I need from google? Well, this is the one that does the one other thing I was missing... *good* photo library management. Back up everything to it from your phone using the app, and vis versa.

### System Insurgency
**Iglunix** – Exploring GNU-less Linux because even open source has its orthodoxies that need challenging. GNU's bloat and ideological baggage don't get a free pass just because they were there first. Iglunix strips away assumptions and proves you don't need GNU to build a functional Unix-like system. Monoculture breeds weakness. Alternative implementations breed resilience.

**Dérive** – Exploring GNU-less Linux because simplicity isn't the same as dependency. Static linking and minimal design don't get compromised just because dynamic libraries became the default. dérive strips away assumptions and proves you don't need GNU to understand your system from the ground up. Opacity breeds fragility. Comprehensibility breeds control.

## Find My Arsenal
All my work lives on codeberg and github.:
[**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/anoraktrend) [**GitHub**](https://github.com/anoraktrend)

Codeberg gets priority because it's non-profit and community-run – everything GitHub pretends to be before Microsoft writes the checks. GitHub gets mirrors because sometimes you have to work within enemy territory to reach people still trapped there.

I also have my own gitea but I haven't migrated everything yet.

## Core Principles
**Own Your Entire Stack** – From bare metal to application layer. Every abstraction you don't understand is a vulnerability someone will exploit.

**Local First, Cloud Never** – Streaming services are digital sharecropping. Cloud storage is paying someone else to hold your data hostage. Your files belong on drives you can physically touch, in machines you can physically access.

**Minimal Dependencies = Maximum Freedom** – Every library you import is someone else's code running with your permissions. Every framework is someone else's opinions embedded in your project. Build lean. Trust nothing. Question everything.

**Embrace Alternative Implementations** – Software monocultures fail catastrophically. One implementation means one attack vector, one philosophy, one point of failure. Multiple implementations mean resilience, diversity, and freedom from lock-in.

## Battlegrounds
**Self-Hosting & Homelab Infrastructure** – Running servers you control, on hardware you own, in locations you choose. This is the foundation of digital autonomy.

**Terminal Mastery** – The shell isn't just a tool. It's a commitment to direct control, to understanding what your computer actually does instead of trusting some GUI abstraction.

**Media Liberation** – Ripping, storing, and managing your own media collection. Fuck streaming services that can remove content at will.

**System Minimalism** – Every megabyte of bloat is wasted resources and expanded attack surface. Question every "essential" dependency. Most aren't.

**Privacy Through Architecture** – Don't trust privacy policies. Build systems that can't spy on you even if they wanted to.

## Join the Resistance
I'm building networks with developers, sysadmins, and digital freedom fighters who are tired of asking permission to use their own fucking computers. If you're exploring GNU-less systems, building your first homelab, or just sick of corporations treating your computer like their property, reach out via [email](mailto:lucyrandall@helltop.net) or through my repositories.

Better yet: fork my projects, submit PRs, build something better.
