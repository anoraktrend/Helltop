This is my resistance headquarters on the internet. I'm Lucy Ada Randall, and I write code that fights back against the corporate enclosure of computing.

## What I Actually Do

I build open-source software that refuses to compromise with surveillance capitalism. My work lives across [GitHub](https://github.com/anoraktrend), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/anoraktrend), [My Gitea instance](https://git.helltop.net) and [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@anoraktrend) because diversification is survival and putting all your code on a single platform is asking to get fucked.

My technical battlegrounds:

- **Mobile Linux**: Contributing to postmarketOS because Android and iOS are locked-down prisons pretending to be operating systems. Your phone should run a real OS that you control, not a walled garden designed to monetize your every interaction.
- **System Development**: Deep in the Arch Linux user repositories and system-level code because understanding your stack from the bottom up is the only way to avoid dependency hell and corporate backdoors.
- **Open Source Tooling**: Building and maintaining utilities that solve real problems without treating users like products to be harvested.

## This Digital Soapbox

This site is where I document the fight. You'll find technical deep-dives, project announcements, and unfiltered opinions about the state of technology. No corporate-friendly hedging. No "maybe Big Tech has some good points too" false balance. Just honest documentation of building technology that serves people instead of shareholders.

Expect posts about Linux systems, open-source insurgency, and whatever technical challenges I'm currently wrestling into submission.

## Find Me

My work and contributions are scattered across platforms under **anoraktrend** and **lucyinchat**. 

I prioritize decentralized and non-profit platforms, but I maintain presence on corporate ones because that's where people are still trapped. Meet them where they are, show them there's a way out.
