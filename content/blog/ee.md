Fuck the Unix gatekeeping that tells newcomers to "just learn vi" or "RTFM". EE was built to be obvious — a merciless rebuke to the idea that software has to be complicated to be powerful.

This is what good default software looks like: present the functions, label them, and get the hell out of the user's way. EE does that. It's installed in FreeBSD so you always have an editor that respects humans, not rituals.

Why EE matters:

- Discoverability is not a weakness — it's an ethical design choice.
- EE is zero-onboarding: `ee filename` and you edit. No memorized sequences, no panic.
- Systems that ship useful defaults are systems designed for people, not for exclusion.

Use it when you want to stop teaching people how to use your tools and start giving them tools that teach themselves.
